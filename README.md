# Stormy-Xena Modded Minecraft
## Pre-requisites, what do I need?
- RAM (Random Access Memory)
    - Minimum 4GB (4096MB)  // Recommended 6GB (6144MB) allocated
    - Ideally your system will need 16GB+ in total (to run Windows etc. normally)
- Java Installation
    - [Version 17](https://www.oracle.com/uk/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-windows) Specifically
- Minecraft Account
    - A copy of **java** edition (PC), not bedrock/cross-platform
    - Ensure your Mojang account is connected to Microsoft (as per their TOS)
    - If you have a new account, you'll need to run normal/vanilla Minecraft at least once and set your username in the launcher
- FTB (Feed The Beast)
    - Install the [FTB Launcher](https://piston.feed-the-beast.com/app/ftb-app-1.25.8-x64.exe)
    - Log in with your Microsoft/Minecraft credentials
    - In Settings then Instances, set your RAM allocation as mentioned above. Under Misc, move your install location - ideally to an SSD.
    - Install the latest "Direwolf20" Modpack for MC1.20 as shown [here](https://i.postimg.cc/KzgMhyF2/image-2024-05-07-171706636.png)
    - It'll take on average a full minute to load up to the title screen (possibly more/less depending on your computer's hardware). Remember it's loading approx 330 mods into the game.

## Installed and on the title screen, what now?
- Message Stormy @lightningvi on [Discord](https://i.postimg.cc/DfRKz3TN/image-2024-05-07-172324249.png)
    - He'll whitelist you which then allows you to join
    - You'll be provided with the server details if you don't already have them

## Are there any server ground rules?
- Follow "Wheaton's Law" (don't be a dick) or you'll get booted, simple.

## Need some ideas / help to get started?
